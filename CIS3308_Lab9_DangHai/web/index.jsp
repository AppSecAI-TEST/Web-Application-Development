                    The year is 2217 and humankind have spread out through the stars. 
                    Here at Named Space, we are building the future, the future you have in mind. 
                    If youâ€™ve ever wanted to find that home away from home then why not on settle on 
                    another planet, or a comet, or a satellite, or a star? From the bustling metropolis 
                    of Mars to the newly-built outposts in 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b"> Proxima Centauri b</a>, 
                    the universe is your limit. 
                    In our various interstellar spaceships, we outperform the competition in price, speed, 
                    and comfortability. Cruise through the depths of space in our ships and explore the unknown. 
                    What undreamt voyages will you pursue? What new wonders await your discovery? 
                    The frontier is everywhere.
